gender neutral bathrooms map <br />
map 1: basic working google map w/out markers or yelp api <br />
map 2: solved "initMap() is not a function" error, location tracking works! yelp api not working <br />
map 3: playing around with code in a new file, still receives both errors <br />
map 4: added on to map 2--manually added several markers
